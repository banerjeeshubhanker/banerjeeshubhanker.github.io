I am a PhD student at the Unit for Linguistic Data within the Data Science Institute at the University of Galway. My research focuses on automatic term extraction in low-resource scenarios. To achieve this, I explore areas such as zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, data augmentation to enhance performance, and cross-domain methodologies. I am passionate about advancing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to tackle complex linguistic challenges in diverse and underrepresented languages.
