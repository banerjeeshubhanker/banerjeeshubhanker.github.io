We presented the results of the shared Task on Machine Translation in Dravidian  languages at the EACL 2021 workshop on Speech and Language Technologies for Dravidian Languages. As a part of this shared task, we organized four sub-tasks corresponding to machine translation of the following language pairs: English to Tamil, English to Malayalam, English to Telugu and Tamil to Telugu which are available at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/27650. We provided the participants with training and development datasets to perform experiments, and the results were evaluated on unseen test data. In total, 46 research groups participated in the shared task and 7 experimental runs were submitted for evaluation. We used BLEU scores for assessment of the translations.

Dataset
======

The datasets were collected from the repository of Opensubtitles released in 2018 and available
at Opus 5 and consisted of bilingual parallel corpora for each of the four language pairs. We created the training, development and test datasets in the following way: each of the bilingual corpora
were divided into three sub-corpora according to the following criterion: the first 2,000 sentence
pairs were compiled as the test corpora while the next 2,000 sentence pairs were used for the development set and the remaining data was compiled as the training dataset. The English-Malayalam training data had 382,868 sentence pairs, the one for English-Tamil had 28,417 sentence pairs, the English-Telugu training set had 23,222 sentence pairs whereas the Tamil-Telugu dataset had 17,155 sentence pairs

We observed that the multilingual model which used backtranslation for data augmentation outperformed all other models. The paper describing the best performing model can be found at https://aclanthology.org/2021.dravidianlangtech-1.18/
